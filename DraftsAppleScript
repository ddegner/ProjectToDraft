-- Email Thread Processor for Drafts
-- This AppleScript runs as an action in the Drafts app it processes selected email threads from Mail,
-- pulls out the imporant information using OpenAI's GPT-4o, creates a new draft in the Drafts app with the
-- extracted information and original thread content, and includes links to each original message in the Mail app.
-- It runs on a modern MacOS with a bit of Python3.

Ensure that all detailed information is included and is accurate.

Here is the format to follow:

- Format in markdown
- The first line should be the project title, written directly without a heading.
- Subsequent sections should include a heading.
- If a section has no relevant information only write the heading and leave the section blank.

CLIENT INFORMATION:
Include the client or company requesting the work, with their main contact and role if available and relevant contact details such as email or phone numbers. Do not label each piece of information.

AGENCY:

Look for terms such as 'budget', 'cost', 'estimate', 'fee', 'pricing', 'cost breakdown', 'quote', 'rate', or any mention of monetary values (e.g., '$500', 'USD', 'total cost'). Ensure every detail about finances is captured, even if mentioned indirectly.

TEAM AND ROLES:

EXTRA NOTES:
Capture any additional information, such as meeting schedules, important discussions, or extra tasks.

Make sure the project title appears as the first line without a label, and the remaining sections follow with clear headings and spacing."
